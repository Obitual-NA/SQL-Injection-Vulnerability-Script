# SQL Injection Vulnerability Scanner

This Python script automatically scans for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in a specified website. Utilizing `requests` for HTTP sessions and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML, it attempts to identify potential SQL Injection points by injecting special characters into URLs and form inputs, then analyzing the responses for typical SQL error messages.

## Features

- Scans URLs and form inputs for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
- Supports detection of common SQL error messages across different databases (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle).
- Automatically extracts and tests forms found on a webpage.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the following Python packages:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the URL you want to scan as an argument:

```sh
python sql_injection_scanner.py <URL>
```

Replace `<URL>` with the actual URL you wish to scan. For example:

```sh
python sql_injection_scanner.py http://example.com
```

The script will output detected vulnerabilities and detailed information about each vulnerable point.
